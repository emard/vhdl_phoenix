 non cpu addressable region   

 - foreground graphics      rom 2Kx16,
 - background graphics      rom 2Kx16,
 - color palettes           rom 128x6,

-------------------------------------------------

The pixel clock is 5.5MHz, the cpu (8085A) clock is 5.5MHz.

The game is based on two RAM tile_id maps, there is no sprite. Cpu manages all 
graphix on its own except background scrolling. 

video generator counts 352 pixels horizontal :
   96 pixels (12 tiles) non visible, 
  256 pixels (32 tiles) visible

video generator counts 256 lines vertical : 
   48 lines ( 6 tiles) non visible,
  208 lines (26 tiles) visible

Video generator scans 32(horizontal)x32(vertical) RAM address, only 0-25
vertical address contains tile_id data. Vertical address from 26 to 31
are used by cpu as working ram including stack.

There are 2 banks at the same address for foreground and also 2 banks for
background. Bank 1 is used to store graphix map for player one, bank 2 is
used to store graphix data for player two. Cpu control bank switching with
register at 0x7800 (data bit 0).

Working ram is made of 0xC0 (192) bytes in each bank of each map 
(foreground/background). So there is 4 x 192 bytes available.

Video generator can be inverted when player 2 and cocktail mode active.
Register at 0x5800 contains a background horizontal counter offset to produce
background scrolling.

Background horizontal blanking start about one tile after foreground horizontal
blanking. This allow to keep clean the top most foreground text line and for 
cpu to update this shadowed line with new data (MAME missed that point. So
background graphix appears suddenly at top of the screen). There is also 
about one line less at bottom of the screen.

Remaining graphix stuff is as usual : tile_ids from RAM map address 2 graphix ROMs,
These 2 bytes from graphix ROMs are serialized thru shift register or mux. These 
2 bits selects one color among 4 possibilities (00 = black). Color priority is 
given to foreground over background. The color palette ROMs uses the 2 selector bits
and 3 more bits from the tile_id number itself and one more bit from register 
at 0x7800 (data bit 1). Each palette ROM gives one bit for each color red, 
blue, green. So finally there is 2bits for red, 2bits for blue and 2 bits for green.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
Sound is composed of many analog component and NE555 IC in various
situation and one melody chip.

From MAME melody chip allow to play 2 songs :

 - Jeux Interdits (played when beginning first stage)
 - La lettre à Elise (played when finishing fifth stage)

See 'Phoenix_sound_explanation.txt' and 'Phoenix_sound_sheet.pdf' for more
information about analog parts.

------
Tools 
------
You need to build vhdl files from the binary file :
 - Unzip the roms file in the tools/phoenix_unzip directory
 - Double click (execute) the script tools/make_phoenix_proms.bat to get the following files

prom_ic39.vhd
prom_ic40.vhd

prom_ic23.vhd
prom_ic24.vhd

phoenix_prog.vhdl

prom_palette_ic40.vhd
prom_palette_ic41.vhd

*DO NOT REDISTRIBUTE THESE FILES*

VHDL files are needed to compile and include roms directly into the project 

The script make_phoenix_proms.bat uses make_vhdl_prom executables delivered both in linux and windows version. The script itself is delivered only in windows version (.bat) but should be easily ported to linux.

Source code of make_vhdl_prom.c is also delivered.

---------------------------------
Compiling for de2
---------------------------------
You can build the project with ROM image embeded in the sof file. DO NOT REDISTRIBUTE THESE FILES.
3 steps

 - put the VHDL ROM files into the project directory
 - build phoenix_de2
 - program phoenix_de2.sof

--------------------
Keyboard and swicth
--------------------
Use directional left/right key to move, space to fire, up key for shield, F1 to start 1 player,  F2 to start 2 players, F3 for coins.

   0 - 7 : dip switch
             0-1 : lives 3-4-5-6
             3-2 : bonus life 30K-40K-50K-60K

               7 : upright-cocktail 
 
   8 -10 : sound_select
             0XX : all mixed (normal)
             100 : sound1 only 
             101 : sound2 only
             110 : sound3 only
             111 : melody only
